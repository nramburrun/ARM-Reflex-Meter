# ARM-Reflex-Meter

As part of a project, an ARM reflex meter was implemented in Assembly. The meter displays and flashes LEDs until a point where
a specific LED will flash. The designated LED was initialized using input I/O command found in the M3 Cortex manual. 
Once the bit shows up, the user presses a button, and the amount of time between the flashing LED and the button press will be displayed
in the form of LEDs
